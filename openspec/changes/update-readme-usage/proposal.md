# Proposal: Update README Usage Documentation

## Summary
Refine the `README.md` to be more elegant, concise, and user-focused. The update will emphasize how the CLI modifies files and provide clear `npx` usage examples for immediate execution without installation.

## Motivation
The current README provides basic installation and usage instructions but lacks elegance and direct execution examples using `npx`. Users need to quickly understand what the tool does (modifies `openspec/AGENTS.md`) and how to use it with minimal friction.

## Proposed Changes
- Rewrite `README.md` to be shorter and clearer.
- Add a section explicitly explaining the file modification behavior.
- Add `npx` command examples.
- Remove redundant installation steps if `npx` is the primary recommended usage, or keep them as secondary.
